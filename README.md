### Part 1: Software Engineering

#### What is Software Engineering?
Software engineering applies engineering principles to design, develop, and maintain software. It ensures that software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs, making it essential in the tech industry for creating scalable and high-quality solutions.

#### Key Milestones in Software Engineering
1. **1960s**: Birth of software engineering to address the software crisis.
2. **1980s**: Rise of structured methodologies like the Waterfall model, standardizing practices.
3. **2000s**: Introduction of Agile methodologies, promoting flexibility and iterative development.

#### Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1. **Requirements Gathering**
2. **Design**
3. **Implementation**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

#### Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies
- **Waterfall**: Linear and sequential, best for projects with stable requirements (e.g., regulatory software).
- **Agile**: Iterative and flexible, suited for dynamic projects (e.g., mobile apps).

#### Roles in a Software Engineering Team
- **Software Developer**: Writes and tests code.
- **Quality Assurance Engineer**: Ensures software quality through testing.
- **Project Manager**: Oversees project timelines and resources.

#### Importance of IDEs and VCS
- **IDEs**: Tools for coding and debugging (e.g., Visual Studio).
- **VCS**: Manages code changes and collaboration (e.g., Git).

#### Common Challenges for Software Engineers
1. **Complex Requirements**: Mitigated by regular stakeholder communication.
2. **Technical Debt**: Addressed through code reviews and refactoring.
3. **Collaboration Issues**: Improved with collaboration tools.

#### Types of Testing
1. **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components.
2. **Integration Testing**: Checks module interactions.
3. **System Testing**: Validates the complete software.
4. **Acceptance Testing**: Ensures it meets user needs.

### Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

#### Define Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering involves crafting inputs to get the best responses from AI models, enhancing interaction effectiveness.

#### Example of a Vague Prompt
- **Vague Prompt**: "Tell me about history."
  
**Improved Prompt**: "Summarize the key events of World War II and their impact on modern Europe."

**Explanation**: The improved prompt is specific, guiding the AI to provide a focused and relevant response.
